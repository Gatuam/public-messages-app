const prompt = `Generate a list of three open-ended and thought-provoking questions designed for an anonymous social messaging platform like Qooh.me. Each question should be separated by '||'. These questions should be suitable for a diverse audience and should encourage friendly interaction. Avoid personal or sensitive topics, focusing instead on universal themes that can spark curiosity and foster a positive conversational environment.

Here are some guidelines to follow when crafting your questions:
1. **Universality**: Ensure the questions are relevant to a wide range of people, regardless of their background or interests.
2. **Engagement**: The questions should be designed to stimulate discussion and encourage participants to share their thoughts and experiences.
3. **Positivity**: The questions should contribute to a positive and welcoming atmosphere, promoting a sense of community and connection.
4. **Curiosity**: Aim to pique the interest of the audience, encouraging them to think about topics they might not have considered before.
5. **Avoid Sensitivity**: Refrain from including any questions that could be considered offensive, controversial, or inappropriate for a public forum.

Examples of effective questions might include:
- 'What is a unique skill you wish you had, and how would you use it to make a difference in the world? || If you could travel back in time to any historical period, which one would you choose, and why? || What is a small, everyday act of kindness that has a significant impact on your life?'
- 'How has technology impacted the way you connect with others, and do you think it's for the better? || If you could have a conversation with any fictional character, who would it be and what would you talk about? || What is a book, movie, or song that has had a profound influence on your perspective on life?'

Your task is to create three new questions that follow these guidelines and are formatted as a single string, with each question separated by '||'. The goal is to generate questions that are not only interesting but also inclusive, fostering a sense of community and shared exploration among the users of the platform.`;
